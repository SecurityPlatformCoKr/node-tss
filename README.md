================================================================================
NODE-TSS
================================================================================

NodeJS module for accessing the TCG Software Stack and therefore the Trusted 
Platform Module


Currently supports reading and extending PCRs, some key and quote-related
operations.


This was originally part of the webinos project (http://webinos.org/) but was
extracted and turned into a separate project.


Requirements
-------------

1. A TPM or TPM Emulator
2. A valid TSS stack.  I've tested it against the TrouSerS stack.
3. The cvv8 V8 type conversion headers, as provided in the "includes" 
   directory.  More details - http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/wiki/V8Convert


Compilation
-------------

Using node-gyp:

<pre>
$ node-gyp rebuild
</prE>

You will get the following warning: 

../src/tsscommands.c: In function ‘getErrorCode’:
../src/tsscommands.c:38:18: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size


Testing
-------------

There's one test - run the following from the root directory of the module

<pre>
node ./test/test-bridge-main.js
</pre>


TPM Keys
-------------
This API doesn't create keys for you, it needs you to do it.

Go to http://privacyca.com/code.html and follow instructions for the 
Privacy CA client and (if possible) the EK Certificate Extractor.



TODO List / known bugs
-------------

At the moment all operations are synchronous.  This might need to change.

Reading too many PCRs in a row results in a segfault in Trousers (on my PC).  
That might be this module, or it might be trousers
